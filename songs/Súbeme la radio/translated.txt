Turn Up the Radio for Me

Turn up the radio for me
Bring me the alcohol

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder (literally "keeps going up")

Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Let's unite the moon and the sun

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder
Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Today let's unite the moon and the sun

Nothing matters to me anymore
Not the day or the time
Yeah, I've lost everything
You've left me in the shadows

I swear I think about you
I do my best
Time passes slowly
and I'm dying [little by little]
(I'm dying [little by little])

When night comes and you don't respond
I swear I stay waiting at your door
[I live] spending the nights awake
and I keep singing beneath the full moon

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder

Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Let's unite the moon and the sun

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder
Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Today let's unite the moon and the sun

Running from the past
Every "before dawn" morning
I don't find any way
of erasing our history
Drinking to your health
(Drinking to your health)
While I still have breath in me
(While I still have breath in me)
I am only asking you
(I am only asking you)
Break this silence
(Break this silence)

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder

Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Let's unite the moon and the sun

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder
Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Today let's unite the moon and the sun

I go around crazy and desperate in search of your love
Don't leave me in this loneliness, I beg you
Truly, I say to you, come back with me
If you call me, I swear to you that we'll dance

And I want to see you now
I can't stand it anymore
I want to make you hot (literally "give you heat")
Just one more time
I can't stand it anymore
I want to see you now;
Today

I'm not lying to you
I'm still waiting for you
You know well that I love/want you
I don't know how to live without you

I'm not lying to you
I'm still waiting for you
You know well that I love/want you
I don't know how to live without you

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder

Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Today let's unite the moon and the sun

Turn up the radio for me, 'cause this is my song
Feel the bass, which gets louder and louder
Bring me the alcohol, which takes away the pain
Today let's unite the moon and the sun

Turn up the radio for me
Bring me the alcohol
Turn up the radio for me
