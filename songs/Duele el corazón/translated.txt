The Heart Hurts

Only on your lips
I want to finish
All these kisses
That I want to give you

For me I don't care
That you sleep with him
Because I know that you dream

Of seeing me
Woman, what are you going to do
Make up your mind
If you are staying or going
If not, don't look for me anymore

If you're leaving, I'm leaving too
If you're giving me, I'm also giving you
My love, let's dance 'til ten
Until our feet hurt

If you're leaving, I'm leaving too
If you're giving me, I'm also giving you
My love, let's dance 'til ten
Until our feet hurt

With him your heart hurts
And with me your feet hurt
With him your heart hurts
And with me your feet hurt

Only with a kiss
I will finish
This suffering of yours
That makes you cry

For me I don't care
That you live with him
Because I know that you are dying

To see me
Woman, what are you going to do
Make up your mind
If you are staying or going
If not, don't look for me anymore

If you're leaving, I'm leaving too
If you're giving me, I'm also giving you
My love, let's dance 'til ten
Until our feet hurt

If you're leaving, I'm leaving too
If you're giving me, I'm also giving you
My love, let's dance 'til ten
Until our feet hurt

With him your heart hurts
And with me your feet hurt
With him your heart hurts
And with me your feet hurt

Who is him that takes away the cold?
You're going with me, let's rumba
With him you almost cry a river
Maybe he gives you money and has power
But it doesn't fill you, your heart remains empty

But with me it breaks the road
Bandoleer if there is something in life that doesn't work
Throw it out!
No one slows you down, the superwarrior
I know you are a wild beast, go ahead
Throw it out!

If you're leaving, I'm leaving too
If you're giving me, I'm also giving you
My love, let's dance 'til ten
Until our feet hurt

If you're leaving, I'm leaving too
If you're giving me, I'm also giving you
My love, let's dance 'til ten
Until our feet hurt

With him your heart hurts
And with me your feet hurt
With him your heart hurts
And with me your feet hurt

With only a kiss
I want to end
That suffering
That makes you cry
