They Come to See Me

I have the heat from boiling blood
The sweat sprouts from the fear that gets lost
I have the calmness that does not say anything
I am that breeze that gets stronger

Even if the clouds move away
And my skin stays in a drought
I will arrive one day
To unravel my return

I have the land that takes care of the road
I have the branches of a tree without green
I am the one who protects the tired night
I have silhouettes that come to see me

Even if the clouds move away
And my skin stays in a drought
I will arrive one day
To unravel my return

I do not need eyes to find you
I want the scar never close
Everything that runs off spills on me
Everything that I dreamed I already lived it

Even if the clouds move away
And my skin stays in a drought
I will arrive one day
To unravel my return
