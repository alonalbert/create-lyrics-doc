Black and Blue

The city’s called Duke, the state New Mexico
Amongst the gangsters its fame has spread
Because of a new drug the gringos have created

They say the colour is blue and it’s of pure quality
That powerful drug that is circulating in the city
And the people who run the area couldn't stop it

The cartel’s running hot
Because they weren't getting respect
They talk about some ‘Heisenberg’
Who controls the market now
No one knows anything about him
Because they've never seen him

The cartel’s about respect and they never forgive
But that guy’s dead already, he just doesn’t know it
.
Heisenberg’s fame has reached Michoacan
They wanted to come from there to try that crystal meth
That blue stuff that’s now become international

Now it’s living up to the name New Mexico
It looks like Mexico with all the drugs it’s hiding
Except it has a gringo boss known as ‘Heisenberg’
.
The cartel’s running hot
Because they weren’t getting respect
They talk about some ‘Heisenberg’
Who controls the market now
No one knows anything about him
Because they've never seen him

From the fury of the cartel
No one has ever escaped
But that guy’s dead already
He just doesn’t know it
