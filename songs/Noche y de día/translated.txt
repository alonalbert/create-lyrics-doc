Night and day

Today they told me they saw you around the city
Walking on the street in darkness
The night has come already and there's an effect, the time stands still

Today they told me they saw you on the sand
At the beach party under the full moon
As a consequence of that great effect and dance dance dance

There's heat in the city
There's heat in the bay
Come we went on partying night and day
International fusion dance cause it brings joy
Come on that party goes on, night and day

Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Day day

Today they told me you're the queen of the night
That you move your waist with indecency
When night arrives there's an effect ,the time stands still

You're...
not ready to dance alone
You feel the rhythm and you lose control
You're the envy [of the floor] shaking all over
That's why dance, dance dance

There's heat in the city
There's heat in the bay
Come we went on partying night and day
International fusion dance cause it brings joy
Come on that party goes on, night and day

Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Day day

Moon street, light of day
Black white it's turned on
Rum from Cana, witchcraft
Santa Cruz blue bay
Less clothes, wet
Pure fire, cold water
Life's a carnival
Dance all night and day

There's heat in the city
There's heat in the bay
Come we went on partying night and day
International fusion dance cause it brings joy
Come on that party goes on, night and day

There's heat in the city
There's heat in the bay
Come we went on partying night and day
International fusion dance cause it brings joy
Come on that party goes on, night and day

Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night andday
Dance dance dance dance
Dance all night and day
Day day
