Slowly

Yes, you know that I've been watching you for a while
I have to dance with you today
DY
I saw, your eyes were calling me
Show me the way that I go, oh
You you are the magnet and I'm the metal
I'm getting closer and I'm putting together the plan
Just the thought of it accelerates the pulse, oh yeah
Already, already I'm enjoying it more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any trouble

Slowly
I want to breathe your neck slowly
Let me tell you things in your ear
So that you remember when you're not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your labrynth
And make your whole body a manuscript
Turn it up turn it up..... turn it up, turn it up

I wanna see your hair dance
I wanna be your rhythm
I want you to teach my mouth
Your favourite places (favourite, favourite, babe!)
Let me surpass your danger zones
Till I make you scream
And forget your last name

DY
If I ask you for a kiss , come give It to me
I know that you're thinking about it
I've been trying for some time
Mom this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with me makes you, boom boom!
You know that well is looking for my boom boom!
Come taste my mouth to see what It tastes like
I want, want, want to see how much love is enough
I'm not in a hurry , I want to do the trip
Let's start slowly then wildly

Step by step, soft softly
We're going to take it little by little
When you kiss me with such dexterity
I think that you're a malicious delicacy.
Step by step, soft softly
We're going to get caught, little by little
And is just that this beauty is a puzzle
But to put it together, here I have the pieces

Slowly
I wanna breathe your neck slowly
Let me whisper things into your ear
So that you remember if you're not with me
Slowly
I wanna undress you with kisses slowly
Sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up!

I wanna see your hair dance
I wanna be your rhythm
I want you to show me
Your favourite places, favourite, favourite, babe!
Let me surpass your danger zones
Till it makes you scream
And forget your last name
Slowly
We will do It on the beach in Puerto Rico
Till the waves scream, Oh blessed!
So that my seal stays with you (Bail it out)

Step by step, soft softly
We're going to take it little by little
I want you to teach my mouth
Your favourite places, favourite, favourite, babe!
Step by step, soft softly
We're going to take it little by little
Till it makes you scream (Fonsi)
And forget your last name (DY)
Slowly
