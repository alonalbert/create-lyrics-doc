Dancing

I see you and this takes my breath away.
When you look at me I feel my heart
(My heart beats slowly)
And in silence your look tells a thousand of words.
The night when I'm begging of you not to let the sun rise.
 
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing)
Your body and mine filling the void
Moving up and down (up and down)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing)
That fire inside me is driving me crazy
It's filling me up
 
With your physics and your chemistry and your anatomy
Beer and tequila and your mouth with mine
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
With this tune, your colour, your fantasy
With your philosophy my head is empty
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
 
I want to be with you, to live with you
to dance with you, to have
a crazy night with you (a crazy night)
and kiss your mouth (kiss your mouth)
I want to be with you, to live with you
to dance with you, to have a crazy night with you,
with a tremendously crazy one
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)
 
You look at me and take me to another dimension
(I'm in another dimension)
Your heartbeats accelerate my heart
(Your heartbeats accelerate my heart)
What irony of fate not being able to touch you
embrace you and feel the magic of your smell
 
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing)
Your body and mine filling the void
Moving up and down (up and down)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing)
That fire inside me is driving me crazy
It's filling me up
 
With your physics and your chemistry and your anatomy
Beer and tequila and your mouth with mine
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
With this tune, your colour, your fantasy
With your philosophy my head is empty
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
And I can't take it any more (and I can't take it any more)
 
I want to be with you, to live with you
to dance with you, to have
a crazy night with you (a crazy night)
and kiss your mouth (kiss your mouth)
I want to be with you, to live with you,
to dance with you, to have a crazy night with you,
with a tremendously crazy one
