The Bathroom

One love, one love

When I saw you
I was stopped
The heart stopped me from beating
I want us to be alone '
For you, I lose control over myself
Excuse me my love
For this invitation

Let's go to the bathroom, where nobody is watching us
If you do not know me, we'll get to know each other
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
To be one more day so I can not stand it
Let's go 'to the moon, let's go to the 'movies
Let's give each other a kiss that never ends
If you want something serious, you have to see tomorrow
If we are a couple or just homies

Ooh, uoh, uoh
If we are a couple or we are homies
Calm down, you have to see tomorrow

If I see you again, It makes me stop
Breathing again, for watching you dancing
If you know you like me, why do you act like crazy?
When I look at you, you bite your mouth
I just want to see you dancing without clothes
In the same bed, on the same note

Let's go to the bathroom, where nobody is watching us
If you do not know me, we'll get to know each other
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
To be one more day so I can not stand it
Let's go 'to the moon, let's go to the 'movies
Let's give each other a kiss that never ends
If you want something serious, you have to see tomorrow
If we are a couple or just homies

Ooh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriends or we are homies
Calm down, you have to see tomorrow
Ooh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend and girlfriend or we are nothing
Calm down, you have to see tomorrow

Have fun coz life is going fast
Just ike your ex, who was half precocious
With you I've always done more than two
You warm yourself alone, if they put declose, Yeh
Calm down, little by little you get to know me
For now I want to see you in all poses
If you let me take you even inside the closet
You're already hot and it's still not twelve, yeh
Have fun coz life is only one
And my heart stops, you make a lagoon
Call me after one
Santa by day, devil when the moon falls, yeeh

Let's go to the bathroom, where nobody is watching us
If you do not know me, we'll get to know each other
I know it sounds crazy, but I like it so much
To be one more day so I can not stand it
Let's go 'to the moon, let's go to the 'movies
Let's give each other a kiss that never ends
If you want something serious, you have to see tomorrow
If we are a couple or just homies

Ooh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriends or we are homies
Calm down, you have to see tomorrow
Ooh, uoh, uoh
If we are boyfriend and girlfriend or we are nothing
Calm down, you have to see tomorrow

Yeeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
